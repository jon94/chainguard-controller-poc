echo "📋 Current State vs Production State:"
echo "===================================="
echo ""

echo "🔄 CURRENT DEMO WORKFLOW:"
echo "------------------------"
echo "1. ✅ Build container image"
echo "2. ✅ Push image to DockerHub" 
echo "3. ✅ Generate SLSA provenance (in CI logs)"
echo "4. ❌ Attestation stays in CI artifacts (not attached)"
echo "5. ❌ Verification fails (no attached attestation)"
echo ""

echo "🏭 PRODUCTION WORKFLOW:"
echo "----------------------"
echo "1. ✅ Build container image"
echo "2. ✅ Push image to registry"
echo "3. ✅ Generate SLSA provenance"
echo "4. ✅ Sign attestation with private key/keyless"
echo "5. ✅ Attach attestation to registry"
echo "6. ✅ Verification succeeds"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Missing Steps in Our Demo:"
echo "============================="
echo ""

echo "Step 4: Sign the Attestation"
echo "---------------------------"
echo "# What we need to add to GitHub Actions:"
echo ""
echo "- name: Sign SLSA Attestation"
echo "  env:"
echo "    COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL: 1"
echo "  run: |"
echo "    # Sign the attestation file"
echo "    cosign sign-blob --bundle attestation.bundle slsa-provenance.json"

echo "Step 5: Attach to Registry"
echo "-------------------------"
echo "# Attach attestation to the image in registry:"
echo ""
echo "- name: Attach Attestation to Registry"
echo "  env:"
echo "    COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL: 1"
echo "  run: |"

echo "🏗️ Registry Requirements:"
echo "========================"
echo ""
echo "✅ OCI-Compatible Registry:"
echo "   • DockerHub (supports OCI artifacts)"
echo "   • Harbor (full attestation support)"
echo "   • ECR (AWS native support)"
echo "   • GCR/Artifact Registry (Google)"
echo "   • ACR (Azure)"
echo ""

echo "✅ Authentication:"
echo "   • Registry push permissions"
echo "   • Signing key access (or keyless OIDC)"
echo "   • CI/CD service account"
echo ""

echo "📊 SLSA Level 3 Compliance Check:"
echo "================================="
echo ""

echo "🔍 Current Demo Status:"
echo "----------------------"
echo "✅ Hermetic Builds: GitHub Actions isolated runners"
echo "✅ Build Provenance: Complete SLSA v0.2 metadata generated"
echo "✅ Non-falsifiable: Cryptographically signed (would be)"
echo "✅ Hardened Platform: GitHub Actions trusted infrastructure"
echo "⚠️  Attestation Storage: Generated but not attached"
echo ""
echo "📈 SLSA Level: 3 (with attestation attachment)"
echo "📈 Current Level: 2+ (missing attestation attachment)"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Why SLSA Level 3 Matters:"
echo "============================"
echo ""
echo "🔒 Security Benefits:"
echo "   • Tamper-evident build process"
echo "   • Complete supply chain transparency"
echo "   • Cryptographic proof of origin"
echo "   • Compliance with security frameworks"
echo ""

echo "🏢 Enterprise Value:"
echo "   • Regulatory compliance (SOC2, FedRAMP)"
echo "   • Supply chain risk management"
echo "   • Incident response capabilities"
echo "   • Audit trail for security reviews"
echo ""

echo "📋 Implementation Roadmap:"
echo "========================="
echo ""
echo "Phase 1: Current Demo ✅"
echo "   • SLSA provenance generation"
echo "   • Build environment hardening"
echo "   • Validation tooling"
echo ""
echo "Phase 2: Production Ready 🚧"
echo "   • Attestation signing"
echo "   • Registry attachment"
echo "   • Automated verification"
echo ""
echo "Phase 3: Enterprise Integration 🎯"
echo "   • Policy enforcement"
echo "   • Compliance monitoring"
echo "   • Incident response"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Quick Fix for Demo:"
echo "====================="
echo ""
echo "To make our demo show attached attestations:"
echo ""
echo "1. Add Cosign attestation step to GitHub Actions"
echo "2. Use 'cosign attest' instead of just generating files"
echo "3. Verify with 'cosign verify-attestation'"
echo ""
echo "Would you like me to implement this fix?"
